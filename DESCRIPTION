Description: Computes exact coverage fractions for polygon-grid intersections
    and returns results in a sparse two-table format: run-length encoded
    interior cells and individually weighted boundary cells. Uses the
    exactextract algorithm by Daniel Baston, vendored from the
    'exactextractr' package.
