\title{gridburn: Sparse Polygon Rasterization with Exact Coverage Fractions}
\description{
Computes exact coverage fractions for polygon-grid intersections and returns results in a sparse two-table format: run-length encoded interior cells and individually weighted boundary cells. Uses the exactextract algorithm by Daniel Baston, vendored from the 'exactextractr' package.
